He was especially praised by his contemporaries for his biblical subjects, for his skill in representing emotions, and attention to detail.<ref>van der Wetering, p. 268.</ref> Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early \"smooth\" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late \"rough\" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself. Rembrandt must have realized that if he kept the paint deliberately loose and \"paint-like\" on some parts of the canvas, the perception of space became much greater.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 160, 190.</ref> \\n\\nA parallel development may be seen in Rembrandt\\'s skill as a printmaker. In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well. The works encompass a wide range of subject matter and technique, sometimes leaving large areas of white paper to suggest space, at other times employing complex webs of line to produce rich dark tones.<ref>Ackley, p. 14.</ref>\\n[[File:Rembrandt, Portret van Haesje v.Cleyburg 1634.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Portrait of Haesje Jacobsdr. van Cleyburg from Rotterdam (1634) completed during the height of his commercial success|left]]\\n\\nLastman\\'s influence on Rembrandt was most prominent during his period in Leiden from 1625 to 1631.<ref name=\"Wetering-284\">van de Wetering, p. 284.</ref> Paintings were rather small but rich in details (for example, in costumes and jewelry).

Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (\\'\\'Cottages before a Stormy Sky\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1641; \\'\\'[[The Three Trees]]\\'\\', 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the [[New Testament]] than the [[Old Testament]], as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted \\'\\'[[The Night Watch]]\\'\\', the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 288.</ref>\\n\\nIn the decade following the \\'\\'Night Watch\\'\\', Rembrandt\\'s paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (\\'\\'Susanna and the Elders\\'\\', 1637–47).<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 163–165.</ref> At the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 289.</ref> <!--In these graphic works natural drama eventually made way for quiet Dutch rural scenes.-->\\n[[File:Rembrandt - Zelfportret - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1|\\'\\'Self Portrait\\'\\' (1658), now [[Frick Collection]], New York, has been described as \"the calmest and grandest of all his portraits\".<ref>Clark 1978, p. 28</ref>|left]]\\n\\nIn the 1650s, Rembrandt\\'s style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of [[Titian]], and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of \\'finish\\' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt\\'s brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 155–165.</ref> The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting\\'s surface.

He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<ref>White 1969, pp. 5–6</ref> \\n\\nHe worked on the so-called \\'\\'[[Hundred Guilder Print]]\\'\\' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.<ref>White 1969, p. 6</ref> Although the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.<ref>White 1969, pp. 6, 9–10</ref>\\n[[File:Die landschaft mit den drei baeumen.jpg|thumb|upright=1|\\'\\'[[The Three Trees]]\\'\\' (1643)|left]]\\n\\nIn the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used [[hatching]] to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including [[Japanese paper]], which he used frequently, and on [[vellum]]. He began to use \"[[surface tone]]\", leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of [[drypoint]], exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.<ref>White, 1969 pp. 6–7</ref>\\n[[File:B159 Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|[[Conus Marmoreus (print)|\\'\\'Conus Marmoreus\\'\\' or \\'\\'The Shell\\'\\']] is Rembrandt\\'s only [[still life]] etching]]\\n\\nHis prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the 27 self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. The landscapes, mostly small, largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century.

Instead, he created a complex layering of figures in a dramatic depiction of an action, the firing of a musket, affecting some of the characters but not others.

Thus, unlike in a conventional narrative painting, the people depicted are represented in lifelike individual portraits. The style seems to show a real event in a real place, but its complex structure appears contrived or theatrical, while the street setting is invented. It can be seen as a picture of a militia charged with keeping order, but it equally looks like a disorderly scene. It alludes to serious works like \\'\\'[[The School of Athens]]\\'\\' by [[Raphael]], and has been seen as humorous or parodic.<ref name=\"Manca 2022\"/> Manca suggests that the calmness of the two officers in the foreground, continuing to carry out their duty despite the disturbance behind them, indicates their \"moral excellence\"; certainly, their status is clearly indicated, even flattered.<ref name=\"Manca 2022\">{{cite journal |last=Manca |first=Joseph |title=3.

Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new [[catalogue raisonné]] of his paintings.

Rembrandt\\'s authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, [[Julius S. Held]], agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr.&nbsp;Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt\\'s closest and most talented pupils, [[Willem Drost]], about whom little is known. But Bruyn\\'s remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost\\'s authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick; In his 1999 book \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\', [[Simon Schama]] and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both argued for attribution to the master.

For example, the exact subject being portrayed in \\'\\'[[Aristotle with a Bust of Homer]]\\'\\', recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum, has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw.<ref>Schama, Simon (1999). \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\'.

Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master\\'s command of illumination and modeling.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rembrandt Pilate Washing His Hands Oil Painting Reproduction |url=http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |access-date=1 January 2015 |publisher=Outpost Art |archive-date=12 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112111138/http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\\n\\nThe attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing.

In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, \"RHL-van Rijn\" but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, \"Rembrant\".
